# Checkers-Game
This is an AI Checkers game that was written by myself and Jesse Kurtz for our Advanced Artificial Intelligence course in the Masters program at Rowan University.
This program uses an Mini-Max search algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning (to limit the search space) as the backend engine for the Checkers AI.  It uses heuristics 
to evaluate each possible outcome of any move on the board at a given turn.  Depending on the level of difficulty chosen, the AI will look between 2 and 10 levels deep within the tree.
